First some check on the binary to know what we're dealing with
`getfacl level00` `file level00`
The binary is a setuid 32bit unprotected binary thats owned by level01

`objdump -M intel -j .text -d level00`
reverse the binary is enough to understand what it does:
A simple check of a password stored in clear `5276`
Which grant us a shell as level01 since the binary was setuid
